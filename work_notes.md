# Assignment 1

## What went well?
I followed along with the lecture, no problem, and I found adding the six users to SQlite DB easy.

## What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today
There is so much to learn. It is hard to keep track of everything. I find it fascinating that there are soo many ways to solve problems. The massive amounts of libraries remind me of the "There's an app for that"  advertising campaign. In the same way, there always seems to be a library for the problems we are trying to solve. Often, many libraries. 

## What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
This entire unit has felt a lot like follow the leader. I do what I see the instructors do, and I get the outcome we are looking for, but a lot of times, I am not entirely sure why or how something works. I feel like a white belt stumbling around. Things are working because smart people tell me what to do, but I haven't put the pieces together yet.
